## Inference Audiocraft Musicgen on Amazon SageMaker

Deploy Audiocraft Musicgen on Amazon SageMaker using SageMaker Endpoints for Async Inference. 

This solution demonstrates deploying AudioCraft MusicGen models from HuggingFace on Amazon SageMaker. MusicGen models take natural language text as input prompt and generate music as output.

AudioCraft consists of three models: MusicGen, AudioGen, and EnCodec. This repo aims to deploy MusicGen models on Amazon SageMaker for Asynchronous inferencing.

## Solution Overview

![Solution Overview](assets/Musicgen-on-Amazon-SageMaker.png)

1. The users interacts with SageMaker Async Endpoint with the help of SageMaker Studio notebook.
2. The input payload is placed on S3 bucket for inference, generated music will be downloaded from S3 bucket.
3. The deployment and inference happens to Amazon SageMaker Asynchronous endpoint.
4. The [HuggingFace Inference Containers](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/blob/master/available_images.md#huggingface-inference-containers) image will be used as a base image. We will use the image that supports PyTorch 2.1.0 with HuggingFace transformers framework.
5. The SageMaker HuggingFaceModel will be deployed on SageMaker Async endpoint.
6. The HuggingFace model, facebook/musicgen-large in the scope of this blog, will be downloaded to S3 during the deployment. Also, during the inference the generated outputs will be placed on S3.
7. Amazon SNS topics to indicate the success and failure are defined as a part of SageMaker async inference configuration.
