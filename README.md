## Inference Audiocraft Musicgen on Amazon SageMaker

Deploy Audiocraft Musicgen on Amazon SageMaker using SageMaker Endpoints for Async Inference. 

This solution demonstrates deploying AudioCraft MusicGen models from HuggingFace on Amazon SageMaker. MusicGen models take natural language text as input prompt and generate music as output.

AudioCraft consists of three models: MusicGen, AudioGen, and EnCodec. This repo aims to deploy MusicGen models on Amazon SageMaker for Asynchronous inferencing.

## Solution Overview

![Solution Overview](assets/Musicgen-on-Amazon-SageMaker.png)

1. The user invokes the SageMaker Async Endpoint using a SageMaker Studio Notebook.
2. The input payload is uploaded to S3 bucket for inference. The payload consists of both the prompt and the music generation parameters. The generated music will be downloaded from S3 bucket.
3. The `facebook/musicgen-large`  model will be deployed to a SageMaker Asynchronous endpoint. This endpoint will be used to infer for music generation.
4. The [HuggingFace Inference Containers](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/blob/master/available_images.md#huggingface-inference-containers) image will be used as a base image. We will use an image that supports PyTorch 2.1.0 with HuggingFace transformers framework.
5. The SageMaker `HuggingFaceModel` will be deployed to a SageMaker Async endpoint.
6. The HuggingFace model, `facebook/musicgen-large` in the scope of this blog, will be uploaded to S3 during the deployment. Also, during the inference the generated outputs will be uploaded to S3.
7. Amazon SNS topics to notify the success and failure are defined as a part of SageMaker async inference configuration.
